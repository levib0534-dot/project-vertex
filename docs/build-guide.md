# Build Guide

Follow these steps to assemble your Vertex keyboard.

## 1. Diodes and Sockets
Solder the SMD diodes onto the back of the PCB. Ensure the orientation is correct (the line on the diode should match the line on the PCB footprint). Solder the Choc hotswap sockets.

## 2. Controllers
Prepare the Seeed Studio XIAO controllers. Solder the battery leads to the B+ and B- pads on the underside of the XIAO. Flash the firmware via USB before soldering the controller to the PCB to ensure functionality.

## 3. Acoustic Prep
Apply the Tape Mod and O-ring gaskets (see sound-tuning.md) before final assembly of the FR4 sandwich.

## 4. Final Assembly
Insert the switches into the top plate and press them into the hotswap sockets. Secure the bottom plate using the M2 standoffs and screws.

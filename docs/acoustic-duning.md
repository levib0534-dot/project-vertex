# Acoustic Tuning Guide

Vertex is designed to sound better than the average split keyboard. Follow these steps to maximize the sound profile.

## The Tempest (Tape) Mod
Apply two layers of blue painter's tape to the back of the PCB. Avoid covering the hotswap socket holes. This absorbs high-pitched frequencies and emphasizes a deeper resonance.

## The Burger Mount
Place small rubber O-rings on the M2 standoffs between the top plate and the PCB, and between the PCB and the bottom plate. This prevents vibrations from traveling through the case into your desk.

## Switch Choice
We recommend Kailh Choc V3 switches for their tighter tolerances. If using V2, a light application of Krytox 205g0 will create a creamier feel and sound.
